================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The `@JsonCreator` annotation on the constructor may allow deserialization of untrusted data, potentially leading to remote code execution, DoS, or other attacks if the input is not properly validated or the deserialization process is not secured.
Solution: Avoid using `@JsonCreator` and `@JsonProperty` annotations unless absolutely necessary. If used, ensure strict input validation and consider using a secure serialization library or implementing custom deserialization logic with proper security checks. Alternatively, use data transfer objects (DTOs) instead of exposing domain objects directly.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: If the `@JsonProperty` annotation is used with XML-based serialization (e.g., using Jackson's XML module), it may be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks if the XML parser is not configured securely. XXE attacks can lead to disclosure of sensitive data, server-side request forgery (SSRF), or denial of service.
Solution: If using XML-based serialization, ensure that the XML parser is configured securely. Disable external entity resolution and DTD processing. Use a secure XML parsing library that has XXE prevention features enabled by default. Validate and sanitize any untrusted XML input before processing.

Vulnerability: CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Components
Issue: The code imports several third-party libraries, such as Jackson and Swagger. If these libraries are not regularly updated or are using outdated versions with known vulnerabilities, it can introduce security risks to the application.
Solution: Regularly update and maintain the third-party libraries used in the project. Use a dependency management tool to track and manage library versions. Monitor for any security advisories or patches related to the libraries and promptly update to the latest secure versions. Conduct periodic security audits of the project's dependencies.

================================================================================
Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided setObscured method:

Scenario 1: Setting Obscured to True

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToTrue()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured field to true when provided with a true value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument true.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the obscured field is set to true after the method invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured field when provided with a true value.
  This test is important to validate that the method behaves as expected and properly sets the obscured flag.

Scenario 2: Setting Obscured to False

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToFalse()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured field to false when provided with a false value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument false.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the obscured field is set to false after the method invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured field when provided with a false value.
  This test is important to validate that the method behaves as expected and properly clears the obscured flag.

Scenario 3: Setting Obscured to Null

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToNull()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured field to null when provided with a null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument null.
  Assert: Use assertNull to verify that the obscured field is set to null after the method invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured field when provided with a null value.
  This test is important to validate that the method handles null input gracefully and allows the obscured flag to be cleared.

Scenario 4: Verifying Obscured Field Accessibility

Details:
  TestName: obscuredFieldAccessibility()
  Description: This test verifies that the obscured field is accessible and can be retrieved after setting its value using the setObscured method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method and the obscured field.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with a specific value (e.g., true).
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the value of the obscured field matches the value set using the setObscured method.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the obscured field is properly encapsulated and can be accessed after setting its value.
  This test is important to validate that the obscured field is not inadvertently modified outside the setObscured method.

These test scenarios cover the basic functionality of the setObscured method, including setting the obscured field to true, false, and null values, as well as verifying the accessibility of the obscured field. They ensure that the method behaves as expected and maintains the integrity of the obscured flag.
