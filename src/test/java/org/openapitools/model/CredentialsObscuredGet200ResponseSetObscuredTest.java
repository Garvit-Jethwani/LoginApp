================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The `@JsonCreator` annotation on the constructor suggests that this class may be deserialized from untrusted JSON input. Deserialization of untrusted data can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, and other security issues if the deserialization process is not properly secured.
Solution: Avoid using the `@JsonCreator` annotation and the `ObjectMapper` class to deserialize untrusted data. If deserialization is necessary, use a safe serialization format like JSON and validate and sanitize the input before deserialization. Consider using the `@JsonIgnoreProperties` annotation to ignore unknown properties during deserialization.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: The `setObscured` method suggests that the `obscured` field may contain sensitive information. If this field is not properly protected, it could be exposed to unauthorized actors through methods like `toString`, logging, or reflection.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive fields are properly encapsulated and not exposed through methods like `toString` or logging. Use the `transient` keyword to exclude sensitive fields from serialization. Consider using encryption to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.

================================================================================
Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided setObscured method:

Scenario 1: Set Obscured to True

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToTrue()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured field to true when provided with a true value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument true.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to check if the obscured field is set to true after the method invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setObscured method properly updates the obscured field when given a true value.
  This test is important to validate that the obscured state can be enabled programmatically.

Scenario 2: Set Obscured to False

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToFalse()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured field to false when provided with a false value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument false.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to check if the obscured field is set to false after the method invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setObscured method properly updates the obscured field when given a false value.
  This test is important to validate that the obscured state can be disabled programmatically.

Scenario 3: Set Obscured to Null

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToNull()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly handles setting the obscured field to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument null.
  Assert: Use assertNull to check if the obscured field is set to null after the method invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setObscured method allows setting the obscured field to null.
  This test is important to validate that the obscured state can be unset or cleared programmatically.

Scenario 4: Verify Obscured State Change

Details:
  TestName: verifyObscuredStateChange()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly changes the obscured state from its previous value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method and set an initial value for the obscured field.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with a different value than the initial value.
  Assert: Use assertNotEquals to check if the obscured field has changed from its initial value after the method invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setObscured method effectively modifies the obscured state when provided with a different value.
  This test is important to validate that the obscured state can be toggled or updated dynamically.

These test scenarios cover the basic functionality of the setObscured method, including setting the obscured field to true, false, and null, as well as verifying the state change. They ensure that the method behaves as expected and handles different input values correctly.
