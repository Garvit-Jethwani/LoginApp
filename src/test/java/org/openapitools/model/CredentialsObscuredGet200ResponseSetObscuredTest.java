================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The `@JsonCreator` annotation on the constructor may allow deserialization of untrusted data, potentially leading to remote code execution, DoS, or other attacks if the input is not properly validated or the deserialization process is not securely configured.
Solution: Avoid using `@JsonCreator` and `@JsonProperty` annotations unless absolutely necessary. If used, ensure strict input validation and consider using a custom deserializer that validates the input before creating objects. Also, limit the types of classes that can be deserialized using allow/deny lists or custom deserializers.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: The use of Jackson library for JSON processing may be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks if the `enableDefaultTyping()` method is called on the `ObjectMapper`, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files or network resources, potentially leading to sensitive data disclosure or server-side request forgery (SSRF).
Solution: Avoid using `enableDefaultTyping()` method on `ObjectMapper`. If necessary, use a custom deserializer that doesn't allow the resolution of external entities. Also, consider using the latest version of Jackson library with XXE prevention features and ensure that the `JsonFactory` is configured with `FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES` and `USE_BIGDECIMAL_FOR_FLOATS` enabled.

Vulnerability: CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Components
Issue: The use of third-party libraries such as Jackson and Swagger may introduce vulnerabilities if the libraries are not kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and versions, potentially exposing the application to known vulnerabilities.
Solution: Regularly update all third-party libraries to their latest stable versions and monitor for any security advisories or patches. Use a dependency management tool to track and manage library versions and consider using a vulnerability scanner to identify any known vulnerabilities in the used libraries.

================================================================================
Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided setObscured method:

Scenario 1: Set Obscured to True

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToTrue()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured property to true when provided with a true value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument true.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to check if the obscured property is set to true after invoking the method.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured property when provided with a true value.
  This test ensures that the method behaves as expected and sets the obscured flag appropriately.

Scenario 2: Set Obscured to False

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToFalse()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured property to false when provided with a false value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument false.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to check if the obscured property is set to false after invoking the method.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured property when provided with a false value.
  This test ensures that the method behaves as expected and sets the obscured flag appropriately.

Scenario 3: Set Obscured to Null

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToNull()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured property to null when provided with a null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument null.
  Assert: Use assertNull to check if the obscured property is set to null after invoking the method.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured property when provided with a null value.
  This test ensures that the method handles null input gracefully and sets the obscured flag to null.

Scenario 4: Verify Obscured Property Accessibility

Details:
  TestName: verifyObscuredPropertyAccessibility()
  Description: This test verifies that the obscured property is accessible and can be retrieved after setting its value using the setObscured method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method and the obscured property.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with a specific value (e.g., true).
  Assert: Use assertEquals to check if the value of the obscured property matches the value set using the setObscured method.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the obscured property is properly encapsulated and can be accessed after setting its value.
  This test ensures that the obscured property is correctly linked to the setObscured method and can be retrieved for further use.

Note: The actual implementation of these test scenarios would require the complete class definition and the presence of necessary getter methods to access the obscured property for assertions.
