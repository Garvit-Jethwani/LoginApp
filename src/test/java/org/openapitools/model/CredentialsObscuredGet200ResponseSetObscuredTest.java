================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The `@JsonCreator` annotation on the constructor may allow deserialization of untrusted data, potentially leading to remote code execution, DoS, or other attacks if the input is not properly validated or the deserialization process is not securely configured.
Solution: Avoid using `@JsonCreator` and `@JsonProperty` annotations unless absolutely necessary. If used, ensure strict input validation and consider using a secure deserialization library or configure deserialization carefully to prevent exploitation.

Vulnerability: Use of Nullable Types
Issue: The use of `JsonNullable` may introduce null-related issues and make the code more prone to NullPointerExceptions if not handled properly.
Solution: Consider using Java's Optional type instead of `JsonNullable` for better null safety and cleaner code. Ensure proper null checks and handling to prevent NullPointerExceptions.

Vulnerability: Potential Verbose Error Messages
Issue: The Jackson annotations used (`@JsonProperty`, `@JsonCreator`, `@JsonTypeName`) may lead to verbose error messages that could expose sensitive information about the application's internals if not configured properly.
Solution: Ensure that Jackson is configured to provide only generic error messages in production environments. Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation
Issue: The `setObscured` method does not perform any input validation on the `obscured` parameter, potentially allowing invalid or malicious data to be set.
Solution: Implement proper input validation in setter methods to ensure that only valid and expected data is accepted. Use Java's built-in validation annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Min`, `@Max`, etc.) or custom validation logic to validate input data.

================================================================================
Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided setObscured method:

Scenario 1: Set Obscured to True

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToTrue()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured property to true when provided with a true value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument true.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to check if the obscured property of the instance is set to true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured property when provided with a true value.
  This test ensures that the method behaves as expected and the obscured property is properly set.

Scenario 2: Set Obscured to False

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToFalse()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured property to false when provided with a false value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument false.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to check if the obscured property of the instance is set to false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured property when provided with a false value.
  This test ensures that the method behaves as expected and the obscured property is properly set.

Scenario 3: Set Obscured to Null

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToNull()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured property to null when provided with a null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument null.
  Assert: Use assertNull to check if the obscured property of the instance is set to null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured property when provided with a null value.
  This test ensures that the method handles null values appropriately and the obscured property is set to null.

Scenario 4: Set Obscured Multiple Times

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredMultipleTimes()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured property when called multiple times with different values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method multiple times with different values (true, false, null).
  Assert: Use assertEquals or assertNull to check if the obscured property of the instance is set correctly after each invocation.
Validation:
  The assertions verify that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured property when called multiple times with different values.
  This test ensures that the method behaves consistently and the obscured property is properly set regardless of the number of times the method is called.

These test scenarios cover the basic functionality of the setObscured method, including setting the obscured property to true, false, and null values. They also test the behavior when the method is called multiple times with different values. These scenarios ensure that the method works as expected and handles different input values correctly.
