================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The `@JsonCreator` annotation on the constructor may allow deserialization of untrusted data, potentially leading to remote code execution, DoS, or other attacks if the input is not properly validated or the deserialization process is not securely configured.
Solution: Avoid using `@JsonCreator` and `@JsonProperty` annotations unless strictly necessary. If used, ensure strict input validation and consider using a secure deserialization library or configure deserialization carefully to prevent exploitation.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: The use of Jackson library for JSON processing may be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks if not properly configured, allowing attackers to access sensitive data, perform SSRF attacks, or cause DoS.
Solution: Disable external entity resolution in the Jackson XML parser by setting `JsonParser.Feature.ALLOW_BACKSLASH_ESCAPING_ANY_CHARACTER` to `false`. Avoid using the `@JsonTypeName` annotation unless required and validate any external type information.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The `java.net.URI` import and usage may be susceptible to path traversal attacks if user-supplied input is used to construct file paths or URLs without proper validation and sanitization.
Solution: Validate and sanitize any user input used to construct file paths or URLs. Use `java.net.URI` and `java.nio.file.Path` classes for secure path handling and apply strict input validation to prevent path traversal attempts.

Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The use of third-party libraries like Jackson and Swagger without verifying their integrity can introduce vulnerabilities if the libraries are compromised or malicious.
Solution: Implement proper integrity checks when downloading and using third-party libraries. Verify the authenticity of the libraries using digital signatures or checksums from trusted sources. Regularly update the libraries to the latest secure versions.

================================================================================
Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided setObscured method:

Scenario 1: Set Obscured to True

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToTrue()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured field to true when provided with a true value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument true.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to check if the obscured field is set to true after the method invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setObscured method properly updates the obscured field when given a true value.
  This test is important to validate that the obscured state can be enabled programmatically.

Scenario 2: Set Obscured to False

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToFalse()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured field to false when provided with a false value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument false.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to check if the obscured field is set to false after the method invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setObscured method properly updates the obscured field when given a false value.
  This test is important to validate that the obscured state can be disabled programmatically.

Scenario 3: Set Obscured to Null

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToNull()
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly handles a null value passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with a null argument.
  Assert: Use assertNull to check if the obscured field is set to null after the method invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setObscured method properly handles a null value and sets the obscured field to null.
  This test is important to validate that the method can handle null values gracefully without throwing any exceptions.

Scenario 4: Verify Obscured Field Accessibility

Details:
  TestName: verifyObscuredFieldAccessibility()
  Description: This test verifies that the obscured field is accessible and modifiable through the setObscured method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method and the obscured field.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with a specific value (e.g., true).
  Assert: Use assertEquals to check if the value of the obscured field matches the value passed to the setObscured method.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the obscured field is properly accessible and can be modified through the setObscured method.
  This test is important to validate that the obscured field is not inadvertently made private or final, preventing its modification.

These test scenarios cover the basic functionality of the setObscured method, including setting the obscured field to true, false, and null values, as well as verifying the accessibility of the obscured field. They ensure that the method behaves as expected and handles different input scenarios correctly.
