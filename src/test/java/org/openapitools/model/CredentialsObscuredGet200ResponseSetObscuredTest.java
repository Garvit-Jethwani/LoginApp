================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The `@JsonCreator` annotation on the constructor may allow deserialization of untrusted data, potentially leading to remote code execution, DoS, or other attacks if the input is not properly validated or the deserialization process is not securely configured.
Solution: Avoid using `@JsonCreator` and `@JsonProperty` annotations unless absolutely necessary. If used, ensure strict input validation and consider using a custom deserializer that validates the input before creating objects. Also, limit the types of classes that can be deserialized using allow/deny lists or custom deserializers.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: The use of Jackson library for JSON processing may be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks if the `enableDefaultTyping()` method is called on the `ObjectMapper`, allowing an attacker to access sensitive data, execute arbitrary code, or perform DoS attacks.
Solution: Avoid using `enableDefaultTyping()` method on `ObjectMapper`. If necessary, use a custom deserializer that doesn't allow the resolution of external entities. Also, consider using the latest version of Jackson library with XXE prevention features and ensure the parser is configured securely.

Vulnerability: CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Components
Issue: The code imports several third-party libraries such as Jackson and Swagger. If these dependencies are not regularly updated or are no longer maintained, they may contain known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
Solution: Regularly update all third-party dependencies to their latest stable versions. Use a dependency management tool to identify and update outdated or vulnerable dependencies. Also, consider using security plugins that can detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies during the build process.

================================================================================
Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided setObscured method:

Scenario 1: Set Obscured to True

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToTrue
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured field to true when provided with a true value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument true.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to check if the obscured field is set to true after invoking the method.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured field when provided with a true value.
  This test ensures that the method behaves as expected and properly sets the internal state of the object.

Scenario 2: Set Obscured to False

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToFalse
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured field to false when provided with a false value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument false.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to check if the obscured field is set to false after invoking the method.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured field when provided with a false value.
  This test ensures that the method behaves as expected and properly sets the internal state of the object.

Scenario 3: Set Obscured to Null

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredToNull
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly sets the obscured field to null when provided with a null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method with the argument null.
  Assert: Use assertNull to check if the obscured field is set to null after invoking the method.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured field when provided with a null value.
  This test ensures that the method handles null input gracefully and allows setting the obscured field to null.

Scenario 4: Set Obscured Multiple Times

Details:
  TestName: setObscuredMultipleTimes
  Description: This test verifies that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured field when invoked multiple times with different values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setObscured method.
  Act: Invoke the setObscured method multiple times with different values (e.g., true, false, null).
  Assert: Use assertEquals or assertNull to check if the obscured field is set to the expected value after each invocation.
Validation:
  The assertions verify that the setObscured method correctly updates the obscured field each time it is invoked, regardless of the previous value.
  This test ensures that the method behaves consistently and maintains the correct state of the object throughout multiple invocations.

Note: The provided test scenarios assume the existence of an obscured field in the class containing the setObscured method. The actual implementation of the test methods may vary based on the specific class structure and test framework being used.
