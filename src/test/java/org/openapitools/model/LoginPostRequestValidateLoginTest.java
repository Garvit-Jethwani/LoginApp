```
Scenario 1: Valid username and password with letters and numbers

Details:
  TestName: validUsernameAndPasswordWithLettersAndNumbers
  Description: This test checks if the method returns true for a valid username and password that meets all conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a username longer than 5 characters and a password longer than 5 characters containing both letters and numbers.
  Act: Call the validateLogin method with the arranged data.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies valid credentials. This test is significant to ensure that users with proper credentials can log in successfully.

Scenario 2: Username less than 5 characters

Details:
  TestName: usernameLessThan5Characters
  Description: This test checks if the method returns false for a username that is shorter than 5 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a username with less than 5 characters and a valid password.
  Act: Call the validateLogin method with the arranged data.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly blocks login attempts with too short usernames. This ensures user credentials meet required standards.

Scenario 3: Password less than 5 characters

Details:
  TestName: passwordLessThan5Characters
  Description: This test checks if the method returns false for a password that is shorter than 5 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid username and a password with less than 5 characters.
  Act: Call the validateLogin method with the arranged data.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly blocks login attempts with too short passwords. This ensures user credentials meet required standards.

Scenario 4: Password without numbers

Details:
  TestName: passwordWithoutNumbers
  Description: This test checks if the method returns false for a password that does not contain numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid username and a password longer than 5 characters containing only letters.
  Act: Call the validateLogin method with the arranged data.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly blocks login attempts with passwords lacking numerical characters. This ensures password complexity is maintained.

Scenario 5: Password without letters

Details:
  TestName: passwordWithoutLetters
  Description: This test checks if the method returns false for a password that does not contain letters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid username and a password longer than 5 characters containing only numbers.
  Act: Call the validateLogin method with the arranged data.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly blocks login attempts with passwords lacking alphabetical characters. This ensures password complexity is maintained.

Scenario 6: Valid username and password with minimum length and required characters

Details:
  TestName: validUsernameAndPasswordWithMinimumLengthAndRequiredCharacters
  Description: This test checks if the method returns true for a username and password that exactly meets the minimum length and contains required characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a username and a password both exactly 6 characters long containing both letters and numbers.
  Act: Call the validateLogin method with the arranged data.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies valid credentials that meet the minimum length requirement. This test is significant to ensure the method works correctly at boundary conditions.

Scenario 7: Password with special characters

Details:
  TestName: passwordWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test checks if the method returns true for a password containing special characters along with letters and numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid username and a password longer than 5 characters containing letters, numbers, and special characters.
  Act: Call the validateLogin method with the arranged data.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method appropriately handles passwords with special characters, as special characters should not impede meeting the initial criteria.

Scenario 8: Edge case with exactly 5 characters username

Details:
  TestName: usernameWithExactly5Characters
  Description: This test checks if the method returns false for a username exactly 5 characters long.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a username with exactly 5 characters and a password longer than 5 characters containing both letters and numbers.
  Act: Call the validateLogin method with the arranged data.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to clarify the boundary condition where the username length meets exactly 5 characters. It is important to verify that the method correctly enforces the length restriction.

Scenario 9: Edge case with exactly 5 characters password

Details:
  TestName: passwordWithExactly5Characters
  Description: This test checks if the method returns false for a password exactly 5 characters long.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a username longer than 5 characters and a password exactly 5 characters long containing both letters and numbers.
  Act: Call the validateLogin method with the arranged data.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns false.
Validation:
  The reason behind this test is to verify how the method handles the scenario where the password length meets exactly 5 characters, ensuring the length restriction is enforced.
