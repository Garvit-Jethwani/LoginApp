Based on the provided method and instructions, here are several test scenarios for the `setExampleResponse` method in the `ApiUtil` class:

Scenario 1: Successfully Set Example Response

Details:
  TestName: successfullySetExampleResponse
  Description: Verify that the method correctly sets the example response with the given content type and example text.

Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Create a mock NativeWebRequest
    - Create a mock HttpServletResponse
    - Set up the mock NativeWebRequest to return the mock HttpServletResponse
    - Prepare a content type and example text
  Act: 
    - Call ApiUtil.setExampleResponse with the prepared parameters
  Assert:
    - Verify that setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8") was called on the response
    - Verify that addHeader("Content-Type", contentType) was called on the response
    - Verify that the example text was written to the response writer

Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly sets the character encoding, adds the content type header, and writes the example text to the response. It's crucial for verifying the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Handle IOException

Details:
  TestName: handleIOException
  Description: Verify that the method throws a RuntimeException when an IOException occurs while writing the response.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock NativeWebRequest
    - Create a mock HttpServletResponse that throws an IOException when getWriter() is called
    - Set up the mock NativeWebRequest to return the mock HttpServletResponse
    - Prepare a content type and example text
  Act & Assert:
    - Call ApiUtil.setExampleResponse and expect a RuntimeException to be thrown

Validation:
  This test verifies the error handling capability of the method. It's important to ensure that IOExceptions are properly caught and wrapped in a RuntimeException, as per the method's implementation.

Scenario 3: Handle Null NativeWebRequest

Details:
  TestName: handleNullNativeWebRequest
  Description: Verify that the method handles a null NativeWebRequest appropriately.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Prepare a content type and example text
  Act & Assert:
    - Call ApiUtil.setExampleResponse with a null NativeWebRequest and expect a NullPointerException or appropriate exception

Validation:
  This test checks the method's behavior when given invalid input. It's important to ensure that the method fails gracefully when given null parameters, which could happen in real-world scenarios.

Scenario 4: Handle Empty Content Type and Example

Details:
  TestName: handleEmptyContentTypeAndExample
  Description: Verify that the method correctly handles empty strings for content type and example.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock NativeWebRequest
    - Create a mock HttpServletResponse
    - Set up the mock NativeWebRequest to return the mock HttpServletResponse
  Act:
    - Call ApiUtil.setExampleResponse with empty strings for content type and example
  Assert:
    - Verify that setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8") was called on the response
    - Verify that addHeader("Content-Type", "") was called on the response
    - Verify that an empty string was written to the response writer

Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle edge cases where the input strings are empty. It's important to verify that the method doesn't fail in these scenarios and still performs the expected operations.

Scenario 5: Verify Response Encoding

Details:
  TestName: verifyResponseEncoding
  Description: Ensure that the response encoding is always set to UTF-8, regardless of the input.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a mock NativeWebRequest
    - Create a mock HttpServletResponse
    - Set up the mock NativeWebRequest to return the mock HttpServletResponse
    - Prepare various content types and example texts
  Act:
    - Call ApiUtil.setExampleResponse multiple times with different inputs
  Assert:
    - For each call, verify that setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8") was called on the response

Validation:
  This test specifically focuses on the character encoding aspect of the method. It's crucial to ensure that UTF-8 encoding is consistently applied, as this impacts how the response is interpreted by clients.

These scenarios cover the main functionality, error handling, and edge cases for the `setExampleResponse` method based on the provided information and constraints.
